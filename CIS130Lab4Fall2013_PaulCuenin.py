# Write a program to determine the GPA of a student. The student is taking three classes.
# GPA is calculated by dividing the total quality points obtained by the total credit hours
# earned. The quality points for a course are obtained by multiplying the number of credits
# earned for that class by a point value determined by the studentâ€™s numeric grade.
